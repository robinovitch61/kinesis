*Tap & hold in SmartSet firmware is not very useful. The reason is that the hold behavior will only trigger once the timeout elapses. If you are a quick typer, then this get annoying pretty quickly. E.g. QMK solves this by making it possible to interrupt the timeout by pressing another key. So in your example it'd have the following behavior:
*
*Tapping Tab results in Tab.
*
*Holding Tab until the timeout results in Ctrl.
*
*Holding Tab and pressing another key within the timeout results in Ctrl + the other key.
*
*When I still had SmartSet keyboards I tried to tweak the timeout to make it more usable. But with short timeouts the key will never register the tapping behavior.
*
*This is the reason why many people who want mod-tap or homerow mods replace the controller board in the Kinesis Advantage by a KinT controller board that can run QMK. But I am not aware of such a replacement for the Freestyle Edge/Pro. I wouldn't be surprised if it's simply not easily possible, because the keys and the microcontroller are probably on the same PCB.
